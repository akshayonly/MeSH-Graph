# Single Article MeSH Network Graph (SA-MNG)

- This web application visualizes MeSH terms in a PubMed article as Network-Graph representation.

## Objective
Researching about a topic is a tedious process when most of the time is spent on searching articles and figuring out which one to invest further time upon to read. This is a small demonstration for visualizing a research article as a graph. Graphical representation of an article's MeSH terms is the initial step in this process. In the later work, through NLP and Semantic word theory, I'm hoping to extract relevant words (terms) from the abstract. This would then become beneficial, as the researcher would be able to compare and contrast multiple articles through such a graph network visual approach. And to actually solve such case, the second web application is created which can be found below -
