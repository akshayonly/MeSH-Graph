# PubMed MeSH Terms Network Graph (PMTNG)

- This web application visualise MeSH terms in pubmed article as Network Graph representation.

## Objective
- Researching about a topic is tideous process when most of the time is spent on searching articles and figuring out which one to invest further time upon to read fully. 
- The aim of this small demonstration is to check whether this time of searching can be reduced. 
- Graphical representation of an articles MeSH terms is the initial step in this process. 
- In the later work, I'm hoping to extract important words (terms) from the abstract and through NLP and Semantic word theory.
